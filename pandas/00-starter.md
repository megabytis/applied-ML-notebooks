# 📊 Pandas – Data Manipulation & Analysis in Python

**Pandas** is a Python package designed for **data manipulation** and **analysis**.  
The name **Pandas** is derived from the econometrics term **Panel Data**.

Pandas introduces **two core data structures**:

- **Series** – A one-dimensional labeled array.
- **DataFrame** – A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.

These structures make working with **labeled** and **relational** data easy and intuitive.
