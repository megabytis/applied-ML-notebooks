    "# üìò K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ‚Äî Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåç Concept\n",
    "KNN is a **lazy learning** algorithm ‚Äî it doesn't ‚Äútrain‚Äù a model in the usual sense.  \n",
    "Instead, when you ask it to predict, it literally:\n",
    "1. Looks at the *K* closest points to the new sample.\n",
    "2. Checks their labels.\n",
    "3. Takes the **majority vote** for classification (or average for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically ‚Äî ‚Äúshow me your 5 closest friends and I‚Äôll tell you who you are.‚Äù üíÄ\n",

    "## üß© Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Meaning |\n",
    "|------|----------|\n",
    "| `K` | Number of neighbors considered for voting. |\n",
    "| `Distance metric` | How closeness is measured (default: Euclidean distance). |\n",
    "| `Scaling` | KNN is distance-based, so features must be scaled (`StandardScaler`). |\n",
    "| `weights` | `'uniform'` (all neighbors equal) or `'distance'` (closer = higher weight). |\n",

    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Build a KNN Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import and preprocess data  \n",
    "2. Split into train/test  \n",
    "3. Scale features  \n",
    "4. Train KNN with chosen `n_neighbors`  \n",
    "5. Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, recall, f1-score  \n",

    "üëÜ Here, the new point is classified as Category 2 because most of its closest neighbors are blue squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN assigns the category based on the majority of nearby points. The image shows how KNN predicts the category of a new data point based on its closest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The red diamonds represent Category 1 and the blue squares represent Category 2.\n",
    "- The new data point checks its closest neighbors (circled points).\n",
    "- Since the majority of its closest neighbors are blue squares (Category 2) KNN predicts the new data point belongs to Category 2.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is 'K' in K Nearest Neighbour?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm k is just a number that tells the algorithm how many nearby points or neighbors to look at when it makes a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Imagine you're deciding which fruit it is based on its shape and size. You compare it to fruits you already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If k = 3, the algorithm looks at the 3 closest fruits to the new one.\n",
    "- If 2 of those 3 fruits are apples and 1 is a banana, the algorithm says the new fruit is an apple because most of its neighbors are apples.\n",
