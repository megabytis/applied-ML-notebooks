    "- Still assumes **blood sugar and age are independent** given diabetes status\n",
    "- In reality, older people might have higher blood sugar, but we ignore this correlation\n",

    "### **The Math Behind It:**\n",
    "For each continuous feature, instead of counting like in Multinomial NB, we use:\n",

    "### ✅ Perfect For:\n",
    "- **Continuous numerical features**: height, weight, temperature, test scores, prices\n",
    "- **Features that roughly follow bell curves**: many natural phenomena do\n",
    "- **Small to medium datasets**: doesn't need huge amounts of data\n",
    "- **Fast predictions**: just plug values into Gaussian formula\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Avoid When:\n",
    "- **Features don't follow normal distribution**: skewed data, categorical data\n",
    "- **Highly correlated features**: violates naive assumption badly\n",
    "- **Mixed data types**: use other variants or preprocessing\n",
