## 3 Types of ML technique

    - Supervised ML
    - UnSupervised ML
    - Reinforcement learning

# ðŸ“š Supervised Machine Learning

- A type of machine learning where the model learns from **labeled data**.
- Each training example has:
  - **Input features** (e.g., house size, number of rooms)
  - **Output label** (e.g., price)
- Goal: Learn a mapping from inputs â†’ outputs to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- so, overall SUPERVISED means there should be a DEPENDENT DATA.

## ðŸŽ¯ Two Main Types of Supervised Learning

1. **Regression**  
   â†’ Predicts **continuous numerical values**  
   â†’ Example: House price, temperature, salary

2. **Classification**  
   â†’ Predicts **discrete categories/labels**  
   â†’ Example: Spam/Not Spam, Cat/Dog, Pass/Fail
