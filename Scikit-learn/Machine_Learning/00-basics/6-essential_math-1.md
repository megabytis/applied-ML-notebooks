## 1️⃣ Equation of a Line (2D)

In 2D space (x, y), a straight line is defined as: y = mx + c

    - `m` = slope (how steep the line is)
    - `c` = y-intercept (where line crosses y-axis)

> 📌 Example: `y = 2x + 3` → for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 2.

## 2️⃣ Equation of a Plane (3D)

In 3D space (x, y, z), a plane is defined as: ax + by + cz + d = 0

    - `a, b, c` = coefficients (normal vector to the plane)
    - `d` = constant (shifts plane away from origin)

> 📌 Example: `2x + 3y - z + 1 = 0` → defines a flat surface in 3D space.

## 3️⃣ Equation of a Hyperplane (n-D)

In n-dimensional space (used in ML with many features), a hyperplane is: w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b = 0

Or in vector form: wᵀx + b = 0

    - `w` = weight vector (normal to the hyperplane)
    - `x` = input feature vector
    - `b` = bias (intercept)

> 📌 In ML, this is the **decision boundary** in SVM or the **prediction surface** in Linear Regression.
